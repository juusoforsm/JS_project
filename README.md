1	Description of the project:
For this project we created a to-do list which filled these requirements of the assignment:
- The style of the to-do list is retro inspired.
- You can add to-dos to the list by typing on the input and pressing enter or the plus button next to it. Afterwards the to-do is added to the list below and to local storage.
- To-do must be at least 3 characters long. If the field is empty, the application alerts the user to write something. Also, if the input is only 1-2 characters long, the application alerts the user about it being too short. the input fields border turns red if either of these alerts is triggered.
- The input field empties itself when the to-do is added to the list for convenienceâ€™s sake.
- The to-do item includes two buttons, a checkmark and a remove.
- The checkmark allows the use to mark the to-do completed and it draws a line over the item.
- The remove button removes the item from list and local storage.
- The application also includes 4 different buttons below. 3 of them filter the to-dos in the list and 1 removes the completed ones in bulk.
- The 3 buttons are All, active and completed. When All is pressed, every to-do is shown on screen. Pressing active shows all active items and hides the completed ones. And pressing completed shows all completed items and hides active ones.
- The order of the items stays same even when playing around with the filters.
- Looking at the evaluation criteria, we have earned the highest grade 30(excellent).
